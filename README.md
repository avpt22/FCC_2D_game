You will learn:
- How to implement a very simple AI to make the creatures feel alive
- How to control the FPS of our game and how to measure time to trigger periodic events
- How to restart the game by pressing a button
- How to apply collision detection, resolve collisions and use that to simulate physics
- How to use the built-in drawImage method to draw randomized game environments and animated characters from a sprite sheet
- How to capture mouse position and animate an 8 directional sprite sheet based on the relative position between the mouse and the player character
- How to use HTML5, CSS3 and plain vanilla JavaScript to build a game from scratch. We will write and understand every line of code, we will not rely on any external frameworks or libraries
